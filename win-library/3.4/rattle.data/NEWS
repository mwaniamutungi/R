  * Remove the weather.CSV file as it is quite large and takes the
    package size over the prefered 5MB for CRAN. The weatherAUS.RData
    file remains, and include a pointer to the CSV version on
    Togaware.

rattle.data 1.0.1 2017-06-24 21:09:44 Graham.Williams@togaware.com

  * Remove XDF folder and dataset. Don't include proprietary formatted
    data in the open source dataset pacakge. Instead the weatherAUS
    dataset is included as a CSV file.

rattle.data 1.0.0 2017-06-24 12:43:33 Graham.Williams@togaware.com

  * Initial release.
